## Project Overview
This application visualizes five essential search algorithms. Each algorithm employs a unique approach to navigating through a grid to find the most optimal path between a start and an end point. It is designed to be both educational and practical, showcasing the real-world relevance of these algorithms in various fields.

## Featured Algorithms
### 1. Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- **Description**: Explores all possible paths level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **Applications**: Used in network traversal, web crawling, and solving unweighted shortest path problems.

### 2. Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Description**: Explores one path as far as possible before backtracking to explore other paths. 
- **Applications**: Commonly used in maze-solving, puzzles, and decision-making processes like game trees.

### 3. Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- **Description**: Selects paths based on the lowest cumulative cost, ensuring an optimal solution for graphs with varying edge costs.
- **Applications**: Frequently used in logistics, route planning, and network optimization problems.

### 4. Best-First Search
- **Description**: Prioritizes paths based on heuristics to estimate the shortest distance to the goal.
- **Applications**: Ideal for solving navigation problems where heuristic guidance speeds up the search process.

### 5. A* Search Algorithm
- **Description**: Combines the strengths of UCS (actual cost) and Best-First Search (heuristic) to efficiently find the optimal path.
- **Applications**: Widely used in navigation systems, robotics, and AI pathfinding for video games.
